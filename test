#
# Script Name: launch_diagnostics_and_serve.sh
#
# Description:
#   This Bash script automates the process of running a Python script that generates
#   diagnostics data for OpenShift/Tekton/Kubernetes clusters and then starts a
#   built-in Python HTTP server to serve the results through an interactive HTML interface.
#   The script ensures that any user on the same network can access the diagnostics information
#   via a web browser.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed and accessible.
#   2. Place this script in the same directory as your Python script.
#   3. Make sure this script has executable permissions:
#      $ chmod +x launch_diagnostics_and_serve.sh
#   4. Execute the script:
#      $ ./launch_diagnostics_and_serve.sh
#   5. Once the server starts, access the diagnostics view from any machine in the network by:
#      http://<server-ip>:8000/
#      Replace '<server-ip>' with the actual IP address of the machine where the server is running.
#
# Security Note:
#   - The HTTP server launched by this script is for temporary use in controlled environments.
#     It is not secure for production environments as it lacks HTTPS and authentication mechanisms.
