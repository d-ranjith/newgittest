Microservice API Design Document
1. Introduction
Objective: This document outlines the design of the microservice API for managing Helm chart versions associated with code repositories.

2. Authentication and Authorization
2.1. Authentication
Authentication Method: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Token Issuer: An authentication service issues JWT tokens.
Token Flow: Clients obtain JWT tokens through a login endpoint or a third-party authentication mechanism.
2.2. Authorization
Authorization Middleware: JWT tokens are used for authorization.
Roles and Permissions: Define roles and permissions required for various API endpoints (e.g., admin, user, etc.).
3. API Endpoints
3.1. Create Helm Chart Version
Endpoint: POST /chart

    /* Helm chart data structure here */
  }
}
3.3. Get Specific Helm Chart Version
Endpoint: GET /chart/:repository_name/:branch_name/:version
Description: Retrieve a specific Helm chart version for a given repository, branch, and version.

  "chart_data": {
    /* Helm chart data structure here */
  }
}
3.4. Update Helm Chart Version
Endpoint: PUT /chart/:repository_name/:branch_name/:version
Description: Update an existing Helm chart version.
Request Payload:
json
Copy code
{
  "chart_data": {
    /* Updated Helm chart data structure here */
  }
}
Response:
HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
json
Copy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Helm chart version updated successfully."
}
3.5. Delete Helm Chart Version
Endpoint: DELETE /chart/:repository_name/:branch_name/:version
Description: Delete a specific Helm chart version.
Response:
HTTP Status Code: 204 No Content
(No response body for successful deletion)
3.6. Search Helm Chart Versions
Endpoint: GET /chart/search
Description: Search for Helm chart versions based on various criteria.
Query Parameters:
query (string): Search keyword.
project (string): Filter by project name.
page (integer): Page number for pagination.
limit (integer): Number of results per page.
sort (string): Sort results based on specific criteria.
Response:
HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
json
Copy code
{
  "results": [
    {
      "repository_name": "my-awesome-project/frontend",
      "branch_name": "master",
      "helm_chart_name": "chart_name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "chart_data": {
        /* Helm chart data structure here */
      }
    },
    // Other matching repositories
  ]
}
4. Pagination and Error Handling
Implement pagination for search results.
Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
5. Data Model
The data model for Helm chart versions is as follows:

json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "unique_id",
  "repository_domain": "bitbucket.com",
  "repository_name": "my-awesome-project/frontend",
  "branch_name": "master",
  "helm_chart_name": "chart_name",
  "latest_version": "1.0.0",
  "metadata": {
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "readme": "README.md",
    "license": ["company"],
    "tags": ["database", "apis"],
    "enabled": true
  },
  "urls": {
    "repository": "https://url...",
    "homepage": "url",
    "documentation": "url",
    "issues": "url"
  },
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "createdBy": "username",
      "creationTime": "2023-09-15T14:30:00.000Z",
      "lastModifiedTime": "2023-09-16T09:45:00.000Z",
      "triggerBranch": "master",
      "chart_data": {
        /* Helm chart data structure here */
      },
      "authors": ["abc", "xyz"],
      "description": "Description of the Helm chart"
    },
    // Additional versions can be stored here
  ]
}

6. Conclusion
Summarize the key points of the API design and highlight its objectives.
Additional Notes
Mention that this document is a living document subject to changes and updates as the development process progresses.
Specify that the Agile development approach will involve iterative development, and the API may evolve based on feedback and requirements.
In the "Data Model" section, I've included the data structure for Helm chart versions, and I've also updated the document to include the delete option for targeted versions in the API endpoints.
