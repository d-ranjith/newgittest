My SMART goal is to increase the diversity of candidates, especially female candidates, for open software positions in New Jersey by 50% within the next 6 months. To achieve this goal, I will implement a targeted recruitment strategy that focuses on reaching out to women's organizations, universities, and online communities that are dedicated to promoting diversity in the tech industry. Additionally, I will work with the hiring team to review job descriptions and ensure they are inclusive and free of gender biases, and actively encourage employee referrals from underrepresented groups. To track progress towards this goal, I will regularly review candidate demographics and adjust the recruitment strategy as needed to ensure that we are meeting our diversity goals.

My SMART goal is to design and build data pipelines for public cloud EKS deployments within the next 6 months. To achieve this goal, I will collaborate with the development team to identify the data requirements and design an efficient and scalable pipeline architecture. I will also evaluate various tools and technologies available for building data pipelines and select the best-fit solutions for our use case. Additionally, I will ensure that the pipeline is secure, reliable, and meets all compliance requirements. To measure progress towards this goal, I will track the pipeline's performance metrics, such as throughput, latency, and error rate, and continually optimize it for better performance. By achieving this goal, we will have a robust data pipeline that can seamlessly handle large-scale data processing and analysis for our public cloud EKS deployments.

My SMART goal is to attend a management training and capabilities program within the next 12 months to enhance my leadership skills and develop a better understanding of effective management techniques. To achieve this goal, I will research and identify reputable training programs that align with my learning objectives and organizational goals. I will then work with my manager to secure the necessary budget and schedule the training program. Additionally, I will apply the knowledge and skills gained from the training program to improve my team's performance and productivity. To measure the effectiveness of the training program, I will seek feedback from my manager and team members on my performance and assess any improvements in team morale and output. By achieving this goal, I will enhance my management skills and become a more effective leader, ultimately contributing to the success of my organization.

My SMART goal is to establish an effective risk management and accountability framework for our OpenShift Kubernetes and Tekton pipeline within the next 6 months, with the objective of minimizing risks and maintaining pipeline integrity. To achieve this goal, I will conduct a thorough risk assessment of the pipeline, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, and develop a comprehensive risk management plan. This plan will include measures such as implementing access controls, monitoring tools, and incident response protocols. Additionally, I will ensure that all team members are trained on security best practices and that accountability is clearly defined for each stage of the pipeline. To measure progress towards this goal, I will regularly review our risk management plan and assess its effectiveness in reducing risks and ensuring pipeline integrity. By achieving this goal, we will have a robust and secure OpenShift Kubernetes and Tekton pipeline that can effectively manage risks and maintain accountability at all stages of the development process.
