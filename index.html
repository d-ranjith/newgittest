1. Client & Franchise Outcomes Goal
SMART Goal:
Standardize production release guidelines for Rust services used across the internal CI/CD platform by aligning Rust developers and shared infrastructure teams, and deliver adoption-ready documentation and support by end of Q2.

First 6 Months Achievement:

Successfully led the definition and publication of release conventions for Rust-based services within the Tekton/OpenShift/Harness-based CI/CD platform.

Collaborated with Rust developers and the Artifactory platform team to align on metadata and publishing standards.

Published the guidelines with support from platform governance and enabled frictionless onboarding for early Rust adopters.

Actively reviewed and unblocked pull requests across CI/CD initiatives to ensure smooth progress across dependent teams.

✅ 2. Financial Performance Goal
SMART Goal:
Adopt AI-powered development tools (Copilot, Assist AI, Devin) to improve coding, testing, and analysis efficiency, and evaluate their impact on development and QA workflows by June 30, with a target of 10–20% time savings in supported areas.

First 6 Months Achievement:

Integrated GitHub Copilot into daily development environments (VSCode/IntelliJ), reducing effort on repetitive code and boilerplate generation.

Used Assist AI for build metric analysis and small dataset QA, cutting down manual analysis time from hours to minutes.

Selected for early access to Devin, with work beginning in late June to explore further automation opportunities.

Completed foundational AWS training as part of the E3 Hackathon and explored AWS QuickSight for faster data insights.

Estimated early productivity gains equating to $2K–$5K in annualized savings per developer in relevant workflows.

✅ 3. Risk & Controls Goal
SMART Goal:
Design and implement a long-term metrics retention mechanism for Tekton CI/CD build data and build observability dashboards to support performance analysis before and after the TaskHooks rollout, with full readiness by end of June.

First 6 Months Achievement:

Delivered an API and Splunk integration to persist build data in S3 beyond the 90-day default retention period, enabling historical analysis.

Built 3 of 10 planned Grafana panels to monitor CPU/memory trends across OpenShift clusters in preparation for the TaskHooks rollout, which introduces additional pod and TaskRun load.

Enabled better risk visibility and regression tracking for platform infrastructure changes.

Targeted completion of remaining dashboards and pre-rollout validation by end of June to support safer deployment of TaskHooks in H2.
