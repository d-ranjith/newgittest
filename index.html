3. Detailed Improvement Sections
3.1. PVC Cleanup
Problem: Unused PVCs from Tekton builds accumulated, wasting storage and affecting cluster efficiency.
Solution: Automated PVC cleanup policies implemented in the Tekton namespace.
Impact:
Reduced storage usage by X%.
Improved build time by reducing storage contention.
Timeline: Deployed to production on Jan 10, 2025.
3.2. Tekton Resolver
Problem: Static resource definitions in Tekton pipelines limited flexibility and scalability.
Solution: Introduced Tekton Resolver for dynamic resource resolution.
Impact:
Streamlined pipeline configurations.
Reduced manual effort and improved execution times.
Timeline: Deployed to production on Feb 5, 2025.
3.3. Stale Namespace Cleanup
Problem: Stale namespaces consumed etcd resources, degrading cluster performance and causing higher latency.
Solution: Implemented periodic scripts to identify and clean up stale namespaces.
Impact:
Reduced etcd latency by X%.
Improved cluster stability.
Timeline: Completed on Dec 20, 2024.

5. Before and After Comparison
Improvement	Before (Date)	After (Date)
PVC Cleanup	X GB storage usage (Dec 2024)	Y GB storage usage (Feb 2025, Z% reduction).
Tekton Resolver	Static resource definitions in pipelines.	Dynamic resource resolution (Feb 2025).
Stale Namespace Cleanup	High etcd latency (Nov 2024).	Reduced etcd latency by X% (Dec 2024).
6. Future Roadmap
Expand automated cleanup mechanisms to other namespaces.
Pre-allocate dedicated PVCs for resource consistency in Tekton builds.
Optimize parameter injection by replacing ConfigMaps with inline values.
Automate pipeline pruning via Tekton Pruner for long-term cleanup.
Evaluate the feasibility of predictive scaling for cluster resources.
Suggestions for Enhancements
Visual Elements: Incorporate charts or graphs showing performance trends.
Interactivity: Embed live dashboards and allow stakeholders to explore metrics directly.
Feedback Loop: Include a feedback form for stakeholders to suggest improvements or highlight new areas of focus.
Regular Updates: Add a "Latest Updates" section at the top of the document to spotlight recent changes.
