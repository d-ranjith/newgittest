3. Detailed Improvement Sections
3.12. Opt-In Support for Overlay Storage Driver in Buildah
Problem:

The default vfs storage driver used by Buildah for building Tekton container images is slower and less efficient.
This results in increased build times and resource consumption during container image builds in Tekton pipelines.
Solution:

Introduced opt-in support for the overlay storage driver, replacing the default vfs driver.
The overlay driver improves build performance by leveraging file system-level optimizations.
Impact:

Significantly reduced container image build times.
Lowered resource usage during image builds, improving pipeline efficiency.
Provided an option for users to switch between storage drivers as per their requirements.
Timeline: Completed on Dec 2, 2024.
