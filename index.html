🦀 Rust Build Support in Tekton – Usage Guidelines and Guardrails
We’ve introduced Rust build support as a Tekton Task to help teams integrate Rust crate compilation and artifact publishing into their CI/CD pipelines. Below is the technical guidance for using this task effectively and securely.

🔧 Tekton Task Overview
The task compiles Rust code using cargo build and optionally runs cargo test.

Build artifacts (.crate files) are published to Artifactory after successful builds.

Compatible with existing CI/CD environments in OpenShift-based clusters.

📦 Publishing to Artifactory
Rust crate artifacts are published to the shared Artifactory Cargo registry.

Each team must prefix their crate names/folders with their appid to uniquely identify and isolate their crates.

Example:

toml
Copy
Edit
# In Cargo.toml
name = "myteam123-mylib"
This helps prevent name collisions and overwrites.

⚠️ Important Guardrails and Caveats
Shared Namespace: All crates are published under a common (public) namespace in Artifactory.

Artifacts can be overridden or consumed by other teams if naming is not properly managed.

No Write Protection: Artifactory currently does not enforce appid-specific write protection. Crates are effectively public within the org.

Teams are responsible for:

Ensuring uniqueness of crate names using appid prefixing.

Verifying their own crate dependencies to avoid unintentional conflicts.

📝 Required Metadata in Cargo.toml
To support traceability and artifact validation, include the following metadata in your Cargo.toml:

toml
Copy
Edit
[package]
name = "myappid-mycrate"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Team ABC <teamabc@example.com>"]
description = "Crate for XYZ functionality, built and published by MyAppID"
license = "MIT"
repository = "https://git.org/path-to-repo"
This metadata helps the Artifactory team and internal tooling identify:

Owning team or appid

Source repo

Contact point (authors)

📏 Standard Naming and Structuring Guidelines
Prefix every crate name with your org-wide appid.

Use hyphen (-) as separator for better readability.

✅ myteam-logger

❌ logger or myteamlogger

Use semantic versioning for crate versions.

Keep Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock committed to version control.

📎 Suggested Tekton Usage

Edit
steps:
  - name: rust-build
    image: rust:1.72
    script: |
      cargo build --release
      cargo publish --token $CARGO_TOKEN
📌 Set CARGO_TOKEN as a Kubernetes Secret injected into the pipeline.

📣 Future Improvements
Plans to restrict Artifactory write access by appid in upcoming phases.

Monitoring crate versioning and duplication patterns for better governance.

Considering automated validation hooks during Tekton builds to enforce naming rules.
