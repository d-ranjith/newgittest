In the first half of the year, I demonstrated ownership and influence by driving standardization of Rust release conventions across the CI/CD platform, coordinating with Rust developers and shared infrastructure teams. I proactively delivered a long-term metrics retention solution using Splunk and S3 to improve visibility into Tekton build performance, addressing a key risk gap. Through the advanced engineering program, I supported 15 teams in adopting DORA metrics, mentoring peers on best practices to improve delivery efficiency. I also consistently unblocked PRs and cross-team dependencies to keep delivery moving.

I’ve actively adopted AI tools such as GitHub Copilot in VSCode/IntelliJ to accelerate daily development, reducing effort in boilerplate code and test creation. Recently selected for early access to Devin, I plan to explore broader automation use cases. I’ve also used org-specific Assist AI to analyze build metrics and QA small datasets, significantly speeding up analysis cycles that would otherwise require manual queries. During the E3 Hackathon, I built foundational AWS knowledge and explored AWS QI tools to interpret platform data collaboratively.

A challenge has been balancing ongoing platform deliverables with scaling support across teams. For the remainder of the year, I’ll focus on completing TaskHook performance dashboards, completing DORA adoption efforts, and deepening integration of AI tools to improve CI/CD velocity and platform observability.


1) Risk & Control Performance Comments
In the first half of the year, I proactively addressed platform risk by designing and implementing a long-term metrics retention solution for Tekton CI/CD build data. This initiative extended observability beyond Splunk’s default 90-day window by persisting metrics in S3, enabling historical trend analysis and faster root cause detection for infrastructure or build regressions. This reduces the risk of undetected performance issues that could impact developer productivity or platform stability.

I also initiated the TaskHook performance readiness project, recognizing potential infrastructure strain due to the increase in TaskRuns and pods. To mitigate this, I began building a Grafana dashboard to monitor CPU and memory usage across clusters. Three panels are complete, with the remainder targeted for end of June ahead of the TaskHook rollout.

A key challenge was ensuring data accuracy and coverage across multiple clusters, given varied monitoring configurations. For the remainder of the year, I will finalize these dashboards, use them to validate the rollout impact, and explore automated alerting strategies to proactively surface risks as platform changes are deployed.

2) Financial Performance Comments
This year, I focused on initiatives that deliver measurable cost savings and developer efficiency. Standardizing Rust artifact publishing conventions across the CI/CD platform has reduced onboarding friction and avoided repeat support cycles — saving an estimated 5–10 hours of effort per team, with projected annual savings of $15K–$30K as more Rust services onboard.

As part of the advanced engineering program, I helped 15 teams adopt DORA metrics to improve pipeline health and velocity. Early improvements in build/test cycles are yielding time savings across multiple squads, with an estimated impact of $10K–$20K per month in productivity value — scaling further as adoption continues.

Additionally, my use of AI tools (Copilot, Assist AI, and Devin early access) has meaningfully reduced effort in development tasks and build data analysis. For example, QA tasks and metric investigations that once took hours are now completed in minutes, enabling faster decision-making and turnaround.

The main challenge has been quantifying some of these soft-cost savings across decentralized teams. In the second half of the year, I plan to collaborate with team leads to collect baseline metrics on time saved and further integrate AI and DORA practices to unlock additional financial and productivity benefits.

3) Client & Franchise Performance Comments
In the first half of the year, I focused on driving collaborative outcomes across multiple teams by improving CI/CD tooling, reducing delivery friction, and enabling better cross-team visibility. I led the rollout of Rust release conventions across our internal CI/CD platform, aligning Rust development teams, platform governance, and shared Artifactory infrastructure to deliver a consistent, traceable publishing process. This effort improved the onboarding experience and reduced confusion for new service teams.

I also supported 15 engineering squads in adopting DORA metrics through Project FI, helping improve delivery reliability and reduce cycle times. This included hands-on guidance with pipeline tuning and test strategies to help teams meet internal performance targets. I regularly reviewed PRs and stepped in to unblock cross-team dependencies, ensuring continued progress on shared initiatives.

Additionally, I’ve embraced the use of AI development tools (e.g., Copilot, Assist AI) to streamline work and improve turnaround times on data analysis — benefiting partner teams by accelerating feedback and reducing support cycles. A challenge remains in ensuring new tools scale well across diverse team needs. In the second half of the year, I’ll continue enabling teams via DORA and AI integration, and support safe rollout of new features like TaskHooks through shared observability tooling and early feedback loops.

1. Standardizing Rust Release Conventions for Internal CI/CD Platform
Primary Corporate Goal: Client & Franchise Outcomes

Successfully delivered a set of standardized production release guidelines tailored for Rust developers using the enterprise CI/CD platform built on OpenShift, Tekton, and Harness.

Partnered with early Rust service teams and the shared infrastructure team managing Artifactory to align on conventions for metadata, artifact publishing, and ownership traceability.

Facilitated working sessions and secured cross-team buy-in, leading to successful adoption by multiple Rust services across the organization.

Published documentation and examples to simplify onboarding and ensure frictionless developer experience.

This initiative directly supports internal developer teams by improving release reliability, creating a consistent user experience, and reducing ambiguity when pushing Rust services to production.

2. Persisting CI/CD Build Metrics Beyond 90 Days to Improve Visibility
Primary Corporate Goal: Risk & Controls

Designed and implemented an API and Splunk UI integration to consume CI/CD build events and persist them to an S3 bucket, extending visibility well beyond the default 90-day Splunk retention period.

Enabled weekly automated data ingestion through a Splunk webhook, with over 6 months of historical data now available for trend analysis and issue investigation.

This solution directly addresses a risk gap: the inability to observe long-term patterns or regressions in build performance, especially after infrastructure or Tekton upgrades.

By enabling long-term performance baselines, the system reduces the operational risk of undetected build degradations that could impact developer teams.

Solution is now live and stable, with feedback gathering planned to iterate based on platform and user team needs.

✅ 3. Infrastructure Performance Monitoring for Upcoming Tekton TaskHooks Rollout
Primary Corporate Goal: Risk & Controls

Initiated proactive assessment of the potential infrastructure impact of converting Tekton Run steps to TaskRun executions (internally referred to as TaskHooks), a change that could increase the number of concurrent TaskRuns and pods in the OpenShift clusters.
