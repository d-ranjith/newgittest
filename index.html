Callbacks:

Validate pre-migration and post-migration hooks using Flyway callbacks.
Custom Code Integration:

Evaluation Metrics
For each use case, consider measuring the following metrics:

Execution Time: Evaluate Flyway's performance, especially for large-scale deployments.
Error Handling: Assess how Flyway manages and reports migration errors.
Ease of Use: Evaluate the user experience with Flyway Desktop, CLI, and Docker.
Scalability: Test Flyway's ability to scale with increasing script and database size.
Integration: Validate the ease of integrating Flyway into CI/CD pipelines and existing workflows.
Tools and Environment
Flyway Desktop:

Target Databases:

Test with a mix of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, Snowflake).
By covering these use cases, your POC will provide a robust assessment of Flyway's suitability for your projects.
