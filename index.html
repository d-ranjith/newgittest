Driving Innovation Through Complex Migrations and Smart Tooling

Our Finding DORA team has made significant strides in advancing engineering excellence by tackling challenges that had never been solved before and building scalable solutions for the future.

Breaking New Ground: Parent-Child Migration Success

In partnership with the ABC team, we successfully migrated a highly complex parent-child application from ABC Classic to ABC Enterprise—a first-of-its-kind achievement. This initiative required leveraging a specialized whitelist service and navigating unique obstacles. By treating the migration as a proof-of-concept, we not only delivered the first-ever parent-child pipeline migration to both ABC and GitHub Enterprise, but also created a detailed playbook documenting every step, challenge, and resolution. This playbook now serves as an invaluable guide, enabling other teams across the company to simplify and accelerate similar complex migrations.

Smarter Insights: The eCapability Explorer Companion

To address the inefficiencies of manual tracking, our team built the eCapability Explorer Companion, a custom tool designed to provide on-demand capability insights at both the team and organizational level.

For Developers: The Direct Pipeline Search feature gives engineers real-time visibility into pipeline-specific enablers, delivering quick, actionable insights without digging through spreadsheets.

For Managers & Leaders: The Manager Application Extraction feature allows leaders to instantly generate complete, up-to-date capability reports for their entire portfolio. This eliminates manual reporting, accelerates decision-making, and ensures accuracy across applications.

By combining technical breakthroughs with scalable tooling, our team is helping the organization improve developer productivity, operational efficiency, and business agility. These initiatives directly contribute to stronger DORA metrics and support the company’s mission to engineer smarter, deliver faster, and stay ahead of industry standards.
