1. Developer Experience Use Cases
Objective: Enable seamless development, testing, and deployment, while accommodating various database sizes and providing consistency across environments.

Automated Environment Provisioning:

Small Databases: Use Tekton CI to spin up lightweight Oracle database instances within containers for isolated dev and testing cycles.
Medium and Large Databases: Leverage shared development database instances with external connections configured in Tekton, reducing the setup for developers while still providing controlled access.
Future Scaling (SQL Server, MongoDB, Snowflake): Automate provisioning via API integrations. Use Helm charts or Tekton tasks to configure external database instances, providing database-specific settings and parameters.
Streamlined Database Migrations:

Tekton CI: Integrate Flyway or Liquibase for schema versioning directly in CI, packaging migration scripts into container images or Helm charts. Deploy migrations to dev/uat environments for feature branches.
Harness CD: Use Harness to run incremental migration scripts in the deployment pipeline when a pull request is merged into master/main. This process applies migrations automatically, incorporating rollback scripts where needed.
Parallel Testing for DB Changes:

Tekton CI: Leverage Tekton tasks to create parallel, ephemeral test environments in OpenShift, allowing multiple devs to run migration tests without database contention.
Harness CD: Harness can spin up temporary UAT instances if needed to test production-like database configurations.
Unified Logging and Monitoring:

Tekton and Harness Integration: Implement centralized logging (e.g., with ELK stack) to capture and analyze pipeline logs, ensuring insights into errors at each stage.
Performance Metrics: Use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to monitor database health metrics like latency or failed queries across all environments.
2. CI Security and Linting Use Cases
Objective: Protect the CI/CD process and enforce database security standards, especially vital for databases with sensitive data.

Database Configuration Linting:

Tekton CI: Add linters to validate SQL scripts for naming conventions, best practices, and configuration standards, ensuring that databases follow security policies.
Harness CD: Use compliance checks (e.g., PCI, GDPR) as gates in Harness for production deployments, blocking non-compliant changes from deploying.
SQL Injection and Security Scanning:

Tekton CI: Run static analysis tools on SQL scripts to flag risky queries or vulnerable SQL patterns before deployment.
Harness CD: For production deployments, incorporate security scans as pre-deployment steps to validate compliance and data security.
Secrets Management:

Tekton CI and Harness CD: Use OpenShift secrets for database credentials during Tekton tasks. Harness provides additional secret management and role-based access control (RBAC) to securely handle sensitive environment configurations.
Automated Backup Before Migration:

Tekton CI: Create tasks to back up non-production databases before migration scripts are run.
Harness CD: Automate backups for production databases before migration steps, ensuring quick rollback points and disaster recovery.
3. CD Deployment Scenarios
Objective: Support flexible deployment strategies with automatic/manual/zero-click options and ensure rollback for different database sizes.

Deployment Scenarios by Database Size:

Small Databases (Dev/Test Environments):

Auto-Deploy: Configure CI pipelines to fully automate deployments for dev databases after CI completion without manual approvals.
Zero-Click Deployment: Set up Harness to auto-deploy feature flags for dev and UAT environments, allowing changes to be tested with zero friction.
Medium Databases (Staging/Pre-Prod):

Manual Approval with Gates: Configure Harness to require approvals for critical changes moving from UAT to production.
Blue-Green Deployments: Use Harness to deploy new versions in a blue-green or canary fashion, especially for staging databases, ensuring minimal downtime.
Large Databases (Production Instances):

Canary/Feature Flag Deployments: Implement Harness feature flags or canary releases for gradual deployment, allowing production rollout monitoring.
Automated Rollbacks: Configure Harness to auto-monitor database metrics post-deployment, triggering rollbacks upon detecting anomalies like slow query performance or data inconsistency.
Scaling for SQL Server, MongoDB, Snowflake:

Database-Specific Pipelines: For each database type, build custom steps in Tekton and Harness, scaling Flyway or Liquibase configurations.
Dynamic Environment-Specific Configurations: Set environment-specific variables and credentials for each database type within Harness, ensuring flexibility for each deployment model.
