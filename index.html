Revised CI/CD Deployment Use Cases with External Databases
Database Schema Management with External Connectivity

Scenario: Ensure schema changes are versioned and managed consistently across external databases.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Integrate database migration tools (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase) within Tekton tasks to apply schema changes directly to the external databases.
Harness CD: Manage deployments by connecting to the external databases and executing migration scripts as part of the deployment process.
Automated Helm Chart Deployment for External Services

Scenario: Deploy application updates and associated database schema changes simultaneously while ensuring connectivity to external databases.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Build Helm charts that include configurations for connecting to external databases.
Harness CD: Deploy these Helm charts to application services while handling database migrations on the external servers.
Environment-Specific Configuration Management

Scenario: Manage configurations for external databases separately for each environment (development, UAT, production).
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Store connection strings and environment-specific variables in a secure configuration management system.
Harness CD: Inject these configurations dynamically during the deployment process based on the target environment.
Approval Workflow for Database Changes

Scenario: Require DBA approval before executing database migrations in production.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Implement validation tests that run against the external databases in development and UAT.
Harness CD: Set up approval gates requiring DBA validation for changes before executing them against the production database.
Rollback Mechanism for Database Changes

Scenario: Facilitate easy rollback of schema changes applied to external databases.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Create rollback scripts for database changes and store them alongside the migrations.
Harness CD: Utilize Harness's rollback functionality to execute these scripts if needed, ensuring database integrity.
Cross-Environment Testing

Scenario: Validate database migrations in a staging environment that mirrors production but connects to a test instance of the external database.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Create a testing pipeline that deploys the application to a staging environment with a test database.
Harness CD: Ensure the application is thoroughly tested against the test database before moving to production.
Database Performance Monitoring Post-Deployment

Scenario: Monitor the performance of the external database after deployment to detect issues early.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Use performance monitoring scripts as part of the CI process to establish baseline metrics.
Harness CD: Integrate monitoring tools to track performance metrics post-deployment, triggering alerts if performance degrades.
Data Security and Compliance Checks

Scenario: Ensure that all database migrations comply with data security and privacy regulations.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Run automated security checks on migration scripts to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Harness CD: Validate compliance checks as part of the deployment process, blocking unauthorized changes.
Data Migration and Synchronization

Scenario: Facilitate data migrations or synchronization tasks for databases during deployments.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Prepare scripts for data migration tasks and test them in the CI pipeline.
Harness CD: Execute these migration scripts as part of the deployment process, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Incremental Database Changes

Scenario: Use incremental migration scripts to manage small changes to the database schema over time.
Implementation:
Tekton CI: Structure migration scripts in a way that supports incremental updates.
Harness CD: Ensure the deployment process applies these incremental changes sequentially, maintaining database integrity.
Example Workflow with External Database Connections
CI Pipeline in Tekton:

Step 1: A developer commits changes to the application code and database migration scripts.
Step 2: Tekton triggers a pipeline that builds container images, packages Helm charts, and applies migrations to a development instance of the external database.
Step 3: Validation tests run against the development database to ensure all changes work as expected.
CD Pipeline in Harness:

Step 1: Harness initiates a CD pipeline that pulls Helm charts and migration scripts for deployment.
Step 2: The pipeline deploys application changes to the UAT environment, applying database migrations to the UAT instance of the external database.
Step 3: A manual approval step occurs, requiring DBA validation before moving changes to production.
Step 4: Once approved, the production deployment occurs, applying migrations to the production database and tracking changes for compliance.
Summary
This updated structure incorporates the hosting of databases outside of OpenShift while leveraging Tekton for CI and Harness for CD. It emphasizes the importance of secure and controlled database management, approval workflows, and the integration of external databases into the deployment pipelines. By maintaining focus on collaboration between application developers and DBAs, you can ensure a smooth and compliant CI/CD process.
