 1. Standardizing Rust Release Conventions for Internal CI/CD Platform
Primary Corporate Goal: Client & Franchise Outcomes

Successfully delivered a set of standardized production release guidelines tailored for Rust developers using the enterprise CI/CD platform built on OpenShift, Tekton, and Harness.

Partnered with early Rust service teams and the shared infrastructure team managing Artifactory to align on conventions for metadata, artifact publishing, and ownership traceability.

Facilitated working sessions and secured cross-team buy-in, leading to successful adoption by multiple Rust services across the organization.

Published documentation and examples to simplify onboarding and ensure frictionless developer experience.

This initiative directly supports internal developer teams by improving release reliability, creating a consistent user experience, and reducing ambiguity when pushing Rust services to production.

2. Persisting CI/CD Build Metrics Beyond 90 Days to Improve Visibility
Primary Corporate Goal: Risk & Controls

Designed and implemented an API and Splunk UI integration to consume CI/CD build events and persist them to an S3 bucket, extending visibility well beyond the default 90-day Splunk retention period.

Enabled weekly automated data ingestion through a Splunk webhook, with over 6 months of historical data now available for trend analysis and issue investigation.

This solution directly addresses a risk gap: the inability to observe long-term patterns or regressions in build performance, especially after infrastructure or Tekton upgrades.

By enabling long-term performance baselines, the system reduces the operational risk of undetected build degradations that could impact developer teams.

Solution is now live and stable, with feedback gathering planned to iterate based on platform and user team needs.

✅ 3. Infrastructure Performance Monitoring for Upcoming Tekton TaskHooks Rollout
Primary Corporate Goal: Risk & Controls

Initiated proactive assessment of the potential infrastructure impact of converting Tekton Run steps to TaskRun executions (internally referred to as TaskHooks), a change that could increase the number of concurrent TaskRuns and pods in the OpenShift clusters.

The concern is that shared TaskRuns across multiple pipelines could lead to increased CPU and memory usage at scale, affecting cluster stability and scheduling performance.

Designed a monitoring strategy using Grafana, aimed at visualizing memory and CPU trends before and after rollout, spanning across multiple OpenShift clusters.

Built 3 out of the 10 planned Grafana panels, tracking key resource metrics like pod count growth, CPU/memory usage patterns, and pod lifecycle trends tied to Tekton workloads. The remaining dashboards are actively in development, with full delivery targeted by end of June — ahead of the TaskHooks rollout.

This initiative enables data-driven rollout decisions and capacity planning, reducing the risk of production instability during the CI/CD platform upgrade.

4. Leading Advanced Engineering Initiative to Improve DORA Metrics Adoption
Primary Corporate Goal: Leadership Principles

Participated in an Advanced Engineering training initiative from March through September, supporting enterprise-wide efforts to modernize CI/CD practices and improve platform adoption of DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics through Project FI.

Directly assisted 15 CI/CD pipeline teams in integrating and evaluating their performance against key DORA metrics, such as lead time, deployment frequency, and mean time to recovery — with a focus on improving engineering velocity and reducing cycle time.

Acted as a mentor and technical advisor to peer participants in the training cohort, sharing best practices in CI/CD, build optimizations, and test automation to influence their project trajectories.

Currently 40% of the transformation efforts are complete, with the remaining planned through September. Provided regular status updates, and stakeholder briefings, and demonstrated leadership in aligning platform capabilities with real-world engineering outcomes.

Also engaged in multiple leadership and project management workshops, taking ownership of coordination across teams and presenting technical benefits, ROI, and next steps for wider adoption.
